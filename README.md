# STACK - GenZ Web3 Investment Platform

STACK is a Web3-native investment platform designed specifically for Gen Z users who are underserved by traditional banks and overwhelmed by complex crypto tools. It enables instant wealth-building through a hybrid model: fiat-to-stablecoin on-ramps, seamless investment in stocks/ETFs, and a protective AI CFO.

The platform bridges the gap between traditional finance and Web3 by providing a safe, frictionless investment experience that demystifies Web3 while outperforming legacy banking in speed and fairness.

## 🎯 Mission

To empower the next generation of investors with a platform that combines the accessibility of traditional finance with the innovation of Web3, delivered through an experience that feels designed for Gen Z culture.

## 🎯 Goals & Background

- Validate market viability by processing $1,000,000 in investments within the first year
- Position STACK as the first mover in the Gen Z-native hybrid Web3 + traditional finance investment space

### User Goals
- Create a safe, frictionless investment platform that demystifies Web3 while outperforming legacy banking in speed and fairness
- Deliver a product experience that matches the expectations of digital-native Gen Z: fast, social, intuitive, and aligned with values like sustainability and fairness
- Encourage consistent investing behavior through gamification and protective guidance from an AI CFO
