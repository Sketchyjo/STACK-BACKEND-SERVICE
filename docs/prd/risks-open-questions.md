# Risks & Open Questions

## Key Risks
1.  **Regulatory Risk:**
    * Hybrid Web3 + traditional model may face compliance challenges in multiple jurisdictions.
    * Potential impact on stablecoin usage, custody models, and cross-border flows.

2.  **Execution Risk:**
    * Tight 3-week MVP timeline creates potential for scope creep or missed deadlines.
    * Reliance on multiple third-party APIs increases fragility.

3.  **Technical Risk (APIs):**
    * Performance and reliability of 0G, Circle, and Alpaca APIs are critical to user experience.
    * Unknown at-scale costs of API usage.

4.  **Market Risk (User Trust):**
    * Gen Z skepticism toward both banks and crypto means adoption may be slower than expected.
    * Building trust will require careful onboarding and consistent reliability.
