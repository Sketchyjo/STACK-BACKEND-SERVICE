## Summary

STACK is a Web3-native investment app designed for Gen Z users who are underserved by traditional banks and overwhelmed by complex crypto tools. It enables instant wealth-building through a hybrid model: fiat-to-stablecoin on-ramps, seamless investment in stocks/ETFs/options, and a protective AI CFO. The MVP focuses on onboarding, wallet management, stablecoin deposits (with off-ramping to a broker), curated baskets, and a simplified investing flow. The long-term vision is to expand into a social, gamified financial hub.

## Goals & Background

### Business Goals
- Drive rapid adoption with 10,000 Monthly Active Users (MAU) within the first 6 months of launch.
- Establish a recurring revenue stream by converting at least 5% of free users into premium subscribers in year one.
- Validate market viability by processing $1,000,000 in investments within the first year.
- Position STACK as the first mover in the Gen Z-native hybrid Web3 + traditional finance investment space.

### User Goals
- Create a safe, frictionless investment platform that demystifies Web3 while outperforming legacy banking in speed and fairness.
- Deliver a product experience that matches the expectations of digital-native Gen Z: fast, social, intuitive, and aligned with values like sustainability and fairness.
- Encourage consistent investing behavior through gamification and protective guidance from an AI CFO.

### Background Context
The financial market for Gen Z is underserved. Traditional banking alienates younger users with fees, delays, and outdated UX, while Web3 remains a minefield of technical risks and hidden costs. Competitors like Cash App, Robinhood, and Coinbase capture fragments of the opportunity but fail to fully address the **trust + usability gap**. STACK bridges this gap with a hybrid model and an experience that feels designed for Gen Z culture.
