# 1\. Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for STACK, refactored for a **Go** backend. It details the integration of **Circle Developer-Controlled Wallets** for wallet management/funding and **Alpaca** as the brokerage partner. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
This document covers the backend services. A separate Frontend Architecture Document (for React Native) MUST be used in conjunction with this one.

  * **Starter Template or Existing Project:** N/A - Greenfield project. We are defining the structure from scratch.
