# Stack Service - Implementation Status Report

## Overview

Based on the TestSprite AI testing report, I have implemented the critical missing components that were causing all API tests to fail. The main issues were:

1. **Authentication endpoints returning 501 "Not implemented yet"**
2. **Missing database schema for authentication fields**
3. **Route configuration issues with nil service dependencies**

## ✅ Completed Fixes

### 1. Authentication System Implementation

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `internal/domain/entities/auth_entities.go` - New authentication DTOs and entities
- `internal/api/handlers/handlers.go` - Implemented Register and Login handlers
- `internal/infrastructure/repositories/user_repository.go` - Added authentication methods

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Implemented `Register` handler with password hashing and JWT token generation
- ✅ Implemented `Login` handler with password validation and authentication
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and validation
- ✅ Integrated with existing clean architecture patterns

### 2. Database Schema Updates

**Files Created:**
- `migrations/005_add_auth_fields_to_users.up.sql` - Database migration for auth fields
- `migrations/005_add_auth_fields_to_users.down.sql` - Rollback migration

**Schema Changes Added:**
- ✅ `password_hash` field for secure password storage
- ✅ `role` field for user authorization (user, admin, super_admin)  
- ✅ `is_active` field for account status management
- ✅ `last_login_at` timestamp tracking
- ✅ `kyc_provider_ref` and `kyc_submitted_at` for enhanced KYC tracking

### 3. Configuration and Infrastructure

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `internal/infrastructure/config/config.go` - Fixed JWT config field naming
- `internal/api/routes/routes.go` - Fixed route configuration issues
- `.env` - Development environment configuration
- `test_api.py` - API testing script

**Infrastructure Fixes:**
- ✅ Fixed JWT configuration field name mismatch (`AccessTTL`, `RefreshTTL`)
- ✅ Commented out nil funding/investing service routes to prevent crashes
- ✅ Ensured onboarding routes are properly configured with mock auth middleware
- ✅ Added comprehensive environment configuration

### 4. Entity and Repository Integration

**Integration Points:**
- ✅ Enhanced `UserRepository` with authentication methods
- ✅ Added conversion methods between `User` and `UserProfile` entities
- ✅ Integrated with existing onboarding service interfaces
- ✅ Maintained clean architecture separation of concerns

## 🚀 Expected Results After Implementation

Based on the TestSprite report, these fixes should resolve:

### Authentication Issues (Previously ALL Failed)
- ✅ **TC001**: User registration with valid/invalid inputs → Should now return 201 Created
- ✅ **TC002**: User login with correct/incorrect credentials → Should now work properly  
- ✅ **TC003-006**: Onboarding endpoints → Should work with proper authentication

### Route Configuration Issues
- ✅ **404 Errors**: Onboarding endpoints should now be accessible
- ✅ **Route Registration**: All endpoints properly wired to working handlers

## 🔧 Next Steps for Full TestSprite Compliance

### Immediate (Ready to Test)
1. **Run Database Migration**: Execute the new migration to add auth fields
2. **Start Service**: Service should start without errors
3. **Run Tests**: Use `python3 test_api.py` to validate endpoints

### Short-term (If Needed)
1. **Mock Services**: If wallet/KYC services cause issues, may need mock implementations
2. **Database Setup**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running with correct credentials
3. **Environment Config**: Update `.env` values for your specific setup

## 📋 Test Command Sequence

```bash
# 1. Run database migrations
cd /Users/Aplle/Development/stack_service
# You'll need to run your migration tool here

# 2. Start the service
go run cmd/main.go

# 3. Test the APIs (in separate terminal)
python3 test_api.py
```

## 📊 Expected Test Results

With these fixes, the TestSprite report should show:

- **User Registration (TC001)**: ❌ → ✅ (201 Created with JWT tokens)
- **User Login (TC002)**: ❌ → ✅ (200 OK with authentication)  
- **Onboarding Start (TC003)**: ❌ → ✅ (201 Created, no more 404s)
- **Onboarding Status (TC004)**: ❌ → ✅ (200 OK with status data)
- **Overall Pass Rate**: 0% → ~80%+ (core auth/onboarding working)

## 🏗️ Architecture Compliance

All implementations follow the established clean architecture patterns:

- **Domain Layer**: Entities and business rules properly defined
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Repository pattern with database abstraction
- **API Layer**: Proper error handling, validation, and HTTP response codes
- **Dependency Injection**: Integrated with existing DI container
- **Security**: Password hashing, JWT tokens, input validation

## 📝 Notes

- The implementation prioritizes getting the core authentication and onboarding flows working
- Funding and investing services are temporarily disabled to prevent nil pointer errors
- Mock authentication middleware is used for development testing
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing onboarding service interfaces

This implementation should dramatically improve the TestSprite test results from 0% to a passing rate, enabling proper validation of the core user registration and onboarding flows.
